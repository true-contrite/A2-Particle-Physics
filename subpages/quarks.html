    The six quarks are ordered into pairs, top / bottom, charm / strange, and top /bottom.
    Whilst there are a variety of quarks atoms could be made up of, only the up and down
    are found in protons and neutrons. The rest are found in more exotic and short lived particles.

    Quarks are distinguishable from leptons as they undergo interactions via the strong nuclear force whereas
    leptons don't. It is this strong nuclear force which binds nucleons together and prevents them from repelling.

        Quarks have a property called 'quark confinment' which means you can never get a single quark on it's own
        even if you provided enough energy. The energy would just get changed into more quarks and antiquarks resulting in the creation
        of mesons. Quarks can only exist as mesons, baryons or the newly discovered pentaquarks.
