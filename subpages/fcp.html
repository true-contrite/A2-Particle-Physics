  Force carrier particles, otherwise known as exchange bosons, are point like particles which do not have mass.
  Each particle is associated with one of the four forces, gravity, electromagnetic force, strong nuclear force and weak nuclear force.
  Exchange bosons will only act on particles which have specific properties. e.g - Gravity acts on particles with mass and electromagnetic force acts on particles with electric charge.

   Although the graviton is yet to be observed there is a lot of evidence supporting it's existence. The W & Z bosons were predicted before they were first observed so hopefully the graviton will be out there since it has also been predicted. Projects at CERN and LIGO are attempting to detect the graviton right now and hope to verify its existence in order to unite quantum theory with gravity.
